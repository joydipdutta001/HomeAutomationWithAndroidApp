# Version-1: Room Automation Using an Android App.


<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This project is based on the concept of Room Automation using the android app and the Firebase Database. Here I am using ESP8266 or NodeMCU, which is the most common WiFi development board. ( If you don't have an idea about that kind of development board, visit this link. ) So, the basic concept is that we are building an android app and a Hardware Box ( contains Relays, Power Module And NodeMCU ). In the Android App, you will find buttons for individual lights. The most important part of this project is to design a circuit that can be controlled in both ways (i.e. Manually and Via Internet ). Here I am using Firebase Database to establishing a connection in between our Android App and NodeMCU.
